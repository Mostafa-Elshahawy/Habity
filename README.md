# Info
- Habity is a habit/task tracker app for people who want to track their activities through time.
- The app is built using node.js for the backend and next.js (with typescript) for the frontend.

## Features
- The user is prompted with many choices for the habit or the task to create the model and get info about it.
- The user can create habits with multiple frequencies, such as daily, weekly, and monthly, and the model will be created repeatedly due to this frequency.
- The achievements section will view the user's progress in completing their habits or tasks every day.
- The user can update or delete habits or tasks as they wish.
- When the user completes a habit or a task they should check its status in the app to count it and add it to the achievements section.

## Purpose
- The purpose of the project was to make a customized habit-tracking app that will help people who want to make sure they do a specific action over a long period or to list their everyday tasks.
